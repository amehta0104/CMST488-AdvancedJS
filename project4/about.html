                                <h2 class=" display-3">Hello, my name is Sanjeev Mehta</h2>
                               
                                           <p class=" my-5 lead text-dark"> am a Certified Public Accountant by profession, with over eighteen years of financial management consulting experience. I specialize in helping federal agencies improve their business processes by reviewing their control environment, assessing risks, and identifying existing controls in their financial statement line items processes. Based on the risk assessment and identification of existing controls, I recommend ameliorative measures including inter alia preventive and detective controls to mitigate the risks in recording and reporting of their daily financial transactions, leading to more robust internal controls and streamlined reporting of their overall financial management process.
                                            I am extremely articulate and have a passion for writing. By virtue of my exemplary writing and communication skills, I have determined that I would like to reach out to avid blog readers by educating them on various contemporary topics that affect us currently or will do so, soon.  While admittedly there is a cornucopia of things to write about, I prefer to discuss topics that have often left me flummoxed, like the vastness of the universe and whether we coexist with other beings in our solar system.  Other topics that I am passionate about include nascent technology such as Blockchain, and its use in the circulation and exchange of crypto currencies. Truly, this is one technology that has caused a considerable amount of consternation among the populace. My goal is to elucidate the essential elements of this technology and its impact apropos of crypto currencies.  Occasionally, I will don on my CPA hat and discuss accounting/financial issues that federal agencies appear to struggle with and are seeking resolution for, in the absence of a promulgated guideline.
            
                                            I distinguish my writing style from that of many others by expounding on the topic in a manner that seeks to enlighten someone whose knowledge of the subject may be relatively puerile and dispel any myths that may appertain to it.
                                         
                                            In my spare time, I enjoy reading books and watching television shows that have a beguiling denouement in the story’s plot.
            
                                            I enjoy trying new cocktail recipes, and pride myself on being adept at making the most delectable Margaritas!</p>
